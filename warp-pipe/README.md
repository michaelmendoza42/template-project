Scope: Asset intake workflow for this repository

`warp-pipe/` is the repository's intake folder for assets that have not been routed yet.

Drop a file here when you want the AI to inspect it, infer where it belongs, and move it into the repo's proper structure.

## How to use it

1. Place an asset in `warp-pipe/`.
2. Tell the AI to "check warp-pipe".
3. The AI reads the local instructions, uses the conversation and repo context, and chooses the best destination.
4. The AI moves the asset and records the action in `processed-log.md`.
5. If the destination is unclear, the AI asks one focused question before moving it.

## What belongs here

Examples:

- images, screenshots, and design assets waiting to be filed
- notes or exports that belong somewhere in `docs/`, `plans/`, `tasks/`, or `scratch/`
- one-off files imported during an active conversation when the final home is not obvious yet

## What should not stay here

`warp-pipe/` is a temporary intake area, not a durable storage location.

After processing, assets should usually move into a canonical or clearly scoped destination elsewhere in the repo.

## Routing rules

See `ROUTING.md` for the first-pass routing policy.
