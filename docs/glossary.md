Scope: Shared behavioral and technical terminology for repositories created from this template
Related files: `README.md`, `product/README.md`, `system/README.md`, `standards/documentation-model.md`, `standards/documentation-schema.md`

Use this glossary for terms that should mean the same thing across the repo.

## How this glossary is organized

This glossary has two sections:

- **Behavioral / product / repo terms** — shared language about canonical docs, authority, workflow, and product-facing intent
- **Technical / implementation terms** — internal architecture, state, integration, rendering, reliability, and AI-built structure language

When adding a term, put it in the section that best matches how the term is used.

## Glossary maintenance

Keep this file compact and deduplicated.

Add a term only when it is genuinely shared, repeatedly useful, or important for avoiding confusion during implementation, review, or handoff.

Prefer updating an existing term over adding a near-duplicate. If a term is no longer preferred, mark it as deprecated or alias it to the canonical term instead of silently drifting away from it.

## Behavioral / product / repo terms

### AGENTS.md
The stable agent-instruction file for a repository or subtree. It contains rules that are expected to stay true across many sessions.

### AI explicit proposal
A draft policy, decision, convention, or durable suggestion written down by an AI agent. It is reviewable, but not binding until a human approves it.

### AI implicit decision
A temporary assumption, default, local implementation choice, or inferred convention made by an AI agent without explicit human approval. AI implicit decisions are disposable and may change at any time unless they conflict with human decisions.

### Canonical docs
Durable source-of-truth documentation that humans and agents can rely on repeatedly. In this template, canonical docs are the home for approved durable policy and, when clearly marked, formal proposals under review.

### Product docs
Documentation in `docs/product/` that records intended product behavior, shared language, rules, and invariants.

### Ephemeral work artifacts
Temporary documents that capture active work state, such as plans, task notes, migration slices, and disposable scratch notes. In this template they belong in `work/` and `scratch/`.

### Human explicit decision
A direction, policy, or decision explicitly approved by a human. These decisions are binding until superseded by a newer human-approved decision.

### Human ratification
The human approval step that turns a proposal into a binding repo decision. File placement alone does not count as ratification.

### Inferred memory
Convenience context derived from chat history, tools, or agent memory. It is useful for speed, but it is never the authority for correctness, architecture, onboarding, safety, or operations.

### Promotion rule
The rule that temporary or inferred knowledge must be promoted into a canonical document and explicitly approved by a human before the team relies on it long term.

### Runbook
A repeatable operational procedure stored in `docs/runbooks/`. A runbook should be usable by someone who was not part of the original discussion.

### Scoped operational docs
Explicit instructions that apply only to a specific subtree or workflow rather than the whole repository. A nested `AGENTS.md` is the main example in this template.

### Standards docs
Documentation in `docs/standards/` for repository-wide policy, conventions, testing rules, and structural guidance.

### Warp Pipe
The repository’s intake workflow/folder (`warp-pipe/`) for newly imported assets that need AI-assisted routing into their correct long-term location.

## Technical / implementation terms

### UI architecture terms

#### Component boundary
The functional edge around a component’s responsibilities: what state it owns, what it renders, what it delegates, and what inputs and outputs define its contract.

#### Presentation component
A component primarily responsible for rendering UI from inputs, with minimal business logic.

#### Container component
A component that coordinates data loading, state wiring, side effects, or orchestration for child presentation components.

#### Slot
A named insertion point where callers can provide custom UI or content.

#### Variant
A controlled visual or behavioral mode for a component, usually expressed through props, tokens, modifiers, or style classes.

#### Composition layer
The part of the UI tree that assembles reusable pieces into a larger screen, route, or section.

#### View model
A UI-oriented data shape prepared for rendering, often derived from domain objects so components stay simple.

### State and data-flow terms

#### Source of truth
The authoritative location for a piece of state at a given layer.

#### Derived state
State computed from other state rather than authored directly.

#### Local state
State owned by one component, module, or narrow feature scope.

#### Shared state
State accessed by multiple components, modules, or subsystems.

#### State transition
A defined change from one meaningful state to another, often triggered by user action, async completion, or system events.

#### Event bridge
A small layer that translates one event system, emitter, callback style, or message shape into another.

#### Synchronization point
A place where multiple state updates, async operations, or subsystems must agree before proceeding.

#### Hydration boundary
The seam where serialized, server-generated, cached, or persisted data becomes live runtime state.

### Domain-to-implementation mapping terms

#### Domain model
A representation of business entities and rules as the system understands them.

#### Transport model
The request/response or wire-format representation used across APIs, storage, or messaging boundaries.

#### Persistence model
The shape used to store data in a database, file, cache, or durable medium.

#### Mapping layer
The code that translates between domain, transport, persistence, or UI-specific representations.

#### Normalization
The process of reshaping data into a canonical internal form.

#### Denormalized view
A convenience shape optimized for reads, rendering, or reporting rather than strict normalization.

### Integration terms

#### Adapter
A wrapper that reshapes an external dependency into an internal contract the codebase prefers.

#### Gateway
A boundary object or module that centralizes access to an external system.

#### Provider
A dependency source that supplies configuration, services, contexts, or external capabilities to consumers.

#### Client
A module responsible for making requests to another service or runtime boundary.

#### Facade
A simplified interface that hides a more complex subsystem behind a smaller API.

#### Shim
A thin compatibility layer added to smooth over version, environment, or API differences.

#### Fallback path
An alternate execution route used when the primary dependency, data source, or feature path is unavailable.

### Async and job-processing terms

#### Pipeline
A staged sequence of transformations or operations where the output of one stage feeds the next.

#### Stage
A named step within a pipeline or workflow.

#### Queue
A buffer of work awaiting execution.

#### Worker
A unit that pulls queued or assigned work and executes it.

#### Retry policy
The rule set that determines when and how failed work is attempted again.

#### Idempotent operation
An operation that can run multiple times without changing the final result beyond the first successful application.

#### Dead-letter path
The holding area or failure route for work that cannot be processed successfully after normal attempts.

### Rendering and styling terms

#### Design token
A named design value such as color, spacing, radius, duration, or typography scale intended for reuse.

#### Semantic token
A design token named by purpose rather than raw value, such as `surface-muted` instead of `gray-100`.

#### Layout primitive
A low-level reusable building block for spacing, stacking, alignment, grid, or containment.

#### Interaction state
A visual or behavioral state driven by focus, hover, pressed, selected, disabled, loading, or validation conditions.

#### Motion contract
The agreed timing, easing, trigger, and visibility rules for UI movement and transitions.

#### Rendering path
The path by which a screen or component reaches its final rendered form, including data preparation and conditional branches.

### Code organization terms

#### Module boundary
The responsibility line around a file or module, including what it may import, expose, and coordinate.

#### Public surface
The intentionally supported exports, props, functions, routes, or commands that callers should depend on.

#### Internal API
A callable interface used inside the repo but not intended as a stable public contract.

#### Leaf module
A module with no meaningful internal dependents below it in a subsystem.

#### Orchestrator
A module that coordinates multiple lower-level helpers or services without owning all of their core logic.

#### Utility
A narrow helper with limited state and broad reuse potential.

#### Helper
A supporting function or module that serves a specific local need, usually with less durability than a utility.

### Reliability and debugging terms

#### Invariant
A condition that must remain true for the system to be correct.

#### Guardrail
A code or process constraint that prevents misuse or unsafe change.

#### Recovery path
The route the system uses to restore a safe or usable state after an error.

#### Failure mode
A specific way a component, process, or dependency can break.

#### Probe
A targeted diagnostic check used to observe runtime behavior.

#### Instrumentation point
A code location where logs, metrics, traces, or debug signals are emitted.

#### Backpressure
A condition where downstream capacity limits require the system to slow, buffer, reject, or reshape incoming work.

### AI-built structure terms

#### AI-built abstraction
A component, helper, pattern, or conceptual layer introduced by an AI agent during implementation.

#### Hidden contract
An unstated dependency or assumption that exists in code but is not obvious from names or public APIs.

#### Ghost feature
A capability partially implemented in code but not formally documented, named, or intentionally exposed.

#### Shadow workflow
An operational or code path that exists in practice but is not yet recognized as an official supported workflow.

#### Naming debt
The gap between what a thing is called in code and what it actually does.

#### Intent drift
The condition where a structure’s current behavior no longer matches the reason it was originally introduced.

#### Compression artifact
A misleading simplification introduced by AI or humans when collapsing a complex design into a smaller implementation explanation.

### Documentation hygiene terms

#### Canonical name
The preferred stable term the repo should use for a concept.

#### Alias term
An older, local, transitional, or informal name that points to the canonical name.

#### Deprecated term
A term that should no longer be introduced in new code or docs, even if legacy references remain.

#### Surfaced term
A term intentionally exposed to users, operators, or API consumers.

#### Internal term
A term intended only for maintainers, implementers, and agent handoff.

## Maintenance rule

When the codebase gains non-obvious internal structure, update this glossary before relying on memory or chat context to explain it later.

This is especially important when:

- an AI introduced a new abstraction
- a refactor created a new layer or responsibility boundary
- a hidden workflow became important to operations
- a new internal name started appearing in commits, plans, or reviews

## Entry requirements for future repo-specific terms

For repo-specific additions, use the structured format below when the concise definition is not enough.
These fields are required unless a field truly does not apply:

- **Lives in**
- **Why it exists**
- **Used by**
- **Change risk**

Add these when useful:

- **Depends on**
- **Alias**
- **Surfaced to users**
- **Notes**

```md
### Term name
Short definition.

- **Lives in:** `path/or/subsystem`
- **Why it exists:** brief rationale
- **Used by:** downstream consumers
- **Change risk:** what can break if altered carelessly
- **Depends on:** upstream inputs or collaborators
- **Alias:** older or local names, if any
- **Surfaced to users:** yes/no, and where if yes
- **Notes:** debugging clues, invariants, or migration cautions
```
