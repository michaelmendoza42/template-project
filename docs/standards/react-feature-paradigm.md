Scope: Default feature implementation guidance for repositories scaffolded from this template

This standard defines the default implementation paradigm for product features in projects created from this template.

## Rule

Use React.js as the default paradigm for building new frontend features unless a project-specific standard, decision record, or explicit user direction states otherwise.

## Expectations

- New UI features should be implemented as React components.
- Feature behavior should be organized around React state, props, and composition patterns.
- Non-React implementations for frontend features should be treated as exceptions and documented.

## Validation

Before marking feature work complete, confirm:

- the feature follows React component architecture
- any divergence from React is explicitly justified in project docs or task notes

## Changelog

- Updated related docs to the new taxonomy.

### 2026-05-11
